Convolv Desktop
==============
A quad-console, desktop application based on the [Convolv web app](https://github.com/scribeGriff/math-terminal). It is built for the [Electron runtime](http://electron.atom.io) and uses the [electron-boilerplate](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate) as a development platform.

This project is a work in progress.
